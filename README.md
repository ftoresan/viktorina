# About project viktorina

## Description

This project aims to delivery a tool to create quizzes.

## Motivation

I started it as a way to help my daughter to study, in the same time that I study some new technologies.    

## The name

The word *quiz* is overused, so I chose a word with a similar meaning but in a different language, by random.
